# Layer 2 Token System

## Overview
This project is a conceptual implementation of a Layer 2 token system, enabling the creation and transfer of tokens with unique metadata off-chain for enhanced scalability and speed. The system is designed on top of a hypothetical blockchain where OP_CAT is enabled, allowing for the concatenation of data within script execution.

## Features
1. **Token Creation**: Users can generate unique tokens by concatenating token IDs with metadata.
2. **Transaction Phase (Off-chain)**: Token transfers are conducted off-chain, allowing for rapid and numerous transactions without congesting the blockchain.
3. **Closure Phase**: The final state of token balances is settled on-chain when the off-chain channel is closed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of blockchain, Layer 2 technologies, and Bitcoin Script.
- Node.js and NPM installed for script execution simulation (in a real implementation, these scripts would be part of transactions on a blockchain).


### Usage
1. Token Creation
Users start by creating tokens. Each token has a unique ID and associated metadata, like the token name, symbol, and issuance date.

Script for Creating a Token:

2. Off-Chain Transaction Phase
Transactions are conducted off-chain, with each transaction updating the state to reflect the current token balances of the parties. These transactions are not broadcast to the blockchain immediately but are recorded and agreed upon by both parties.

3. Closure Phase
When the parties decide to settle their balances, the final state of the off-chain transactions is broadcast to the blockchain, finalizing the token distribution based on the latest agreed-upon state.
