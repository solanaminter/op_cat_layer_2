# Assume Alice is sending tokens to Bob
# Stack setup with Alice's balance, Bob's balance, and the transaction amount
<Alice's Token Balance> <Bob's Token Balance> <Tokens to Send>

# Calculate Alice's new balance
OP_SUB      # Subtracts tokens sent from Alice's balance

# Calculate Bob's new balance
OP_ADD      # Adds tokens sent to Bob's balance

# The stack now has Alice's New Balance and Bob's New Balance
